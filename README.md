# n8n-nodes-stripe

This repo contains example nodes to help you get started building your own custom integrations for [n8n](n8n.io). It includes the node linter and other dependencies.

To make your custom node available to the community, you must create it as an npm package, and [submit it to the npm registry](https://docs.npmjs.com/packages-and-modules/contributing-packages-to-the-registry).

For running the trigger we will need to run n8n start --tunnel in the n8n instalation package for getting the webhook in production.
